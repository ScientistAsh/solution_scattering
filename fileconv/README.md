# tpkl2dat_fast

This script converts tpkl files from the Anfinrud lab to dat files. Please alter the script to tell it where to locate the "table.py" script from the Anfinrud lab, so that the tpkl files can be opened properly.

The script should be launched in the directory containing all of the sample-specific directories. If you want to convert the files in one directory at a time, please edit the script as needed (or feel free to make it smarter so that it figures out where it started on its own.)
